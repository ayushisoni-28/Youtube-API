it's getting rid and then all of a
sudden the Jets go on it slows it down
then it almost stopped it and it guides
it over left right up high down I said
what the hell's going on cuz nobody ever
saw this before and then it has the big
Gantry very expensive it looks like it's
going to be smashed his Smither Rines

OLD CLIP OF ELON MUSK ON AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQw20wgIUoA,"so you used to have more hope and you
gave up some of it and now you don't
worry as much about AI you're like this
is just what it
is yeah pretty much yes yes it's not
it's it's but no it's not necessarily
bad it's just it's definitely going to
be outside of human control not
necessarily bad right yeah not it's not
necessarily bad it's just it's just
outside of human control now the thing
that's going to be tricky here is that
it's going to be very tempting to use AI
as a weapon it's going to be very
tempting in fact it will be used as a
weapon um so the the on the the on-ramp
to Serious AI the danger is going to be
more humans using it against each other
I think most likely that'll be the
danger yeah how far do you think we are
from something that can make its own
mind up"

Elon Musk vs. Legacy Media: The Real Story,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ7dg4KKOHM,"I I I agree with you Brian and and by
the way all the new talking points that
are going after Elon Musk it doesn't
tell you anything about Trump or musk it
tells you everything about Legacy Media
and how it works they get one line of
attack and then they repeat it across
every Echo chamber inside the blue
bubble and it doesn't happen on the Fox
News Channel doesn't happen on my radio
show doesn't happen anything I write or
anything you write the problem is Legacy
Media doesn't know everybody now sees
what they're doing they're trying to
make Elon Musk a story line cuz I got no
storyline Donald Trump is the most
accessible president of my lifetime"
"üö®VICTORY: Elon Musk THREATENS to UNSEAT RINOS Voting for MASSIVE Spending Bill, Trump: &#39;It&#39;s DEAD&#39;",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8lim5svdTQ,"what's up guys I have a very
embarrassing admission to make to all of
you I've spent most of my professional
life in Washington DC while I was raised
in Iowa and went to school there I moved
to Washington DC because I had a knack
for government and media and I thought
that would be the best place to start my
career and while there were some ups and
downs certainly I got to know DC culture
and DC culture goes like this uh
Republicans and Democrats uh go back to
their districts lie to their
constituents and then come to DC and do
whatever is best for them their
lobbyists their lawyers their
consultants and the scum who run
Washington DC known as The Blob The Blob
always gets what it wants and it's been
gorging and feasting on taxpayer dollars
for my entire life and your entire life
without any accountability at all and
when people try and get upset about it
like during the Tea Party or during
little spending battles the government
always goes and does the same thing you
don't want to shut down the government
do you you don't want to destroy the
government do you well actually yeah we
do and there's been a massive sea change
in the population of this country and in
the desires of this country for
accountability transparency and
responsibility in a government that we
want to be leaner and more efficient
that's actually what won this election
cycle this is the country that you live
in you live in a red Kingdom you live in
a red country with little blue dots here
and there and this red country is sick
of the way that things have gone in
Washington DC they Ram these giant
spending bills through they call them
Omnibus spending bills and they do these
huge swaps of spending that are tied to
like funding of our military or in this
case Hurricane Relief and so they have
this little nugget for people and then
they just Ram through all of these
grotesque
spending agenda items that are
completely for the lobbyist class have
nothing to do with the American
people ladies and gentlemen something
incredible just happened a literal
Christmas
miracle let me
explain Republican Speaker of the House
Mike Johnson wrote A bill that should
cost him his
speakership this is the bill it includes
gain of function research that's how he
got Co mask and vaccine mandates biolabs
massive Congressional pay raises 60
billion more dollars for Ukraine a DC
Sports Stadium Congress blocking
subpoenas for their data so no one can
get any access to what is actually going
on in Congress corrupt emergency Powers
legal process quashing meaning you can't
sue members of Congress expansion of
government censorship censors which is
insane molasses inspection funding woke
term changes like offender to Justice
involved individual so like this is from
a republican Speaker of the House
transparency and concert ticket pricing
elimination of the word homeless
allowing lawmakers to opt out of
Obamacare oh yeah and a feal swine
eradication program this is not what the
American people voted for and ladies and
gentlemen something incredible happened
we just killed this bill for the first
time in my life there was enough
pressure created by powerful
individuals like Theon Swami and Elon
Musk to Bear down upon these lawmakers
to threaten their seats and threaten
their power and threaten the one thing
that they will refuse to give up they'll
die in office if they can they will
never give up their seat they will never
give power these people will never
resign it's the only thing that they
care about is their little pin their
little badge their little power in
life and we actually killed this bill I
cannot believe it here we go this 1500
page Bill $10 billion worth of spending
masquerading as a continuing
resolution ladies and gentlemen Elon
Musk stated this the bill must die and
any member of the house or Senate who
votes for this outrageous spending Bill
deserves to be voted out in two years
Matt gate saying Elon is not effing
around he's full fully engaged funding
massive efforts this is not an empty
threat well this was pretty scary stop
the steal of your tax dollars says Elon
Musk the Doge saying effectively that
this is a massive pork gluttonous Bill A
continuing resolution by the way is just
to continue federal spending now that
alone is bad enough but this packed in
$110 billion dollar more of federal
spending and they're doing this the the
speaker Mike Johnson is doing this in
order to pay
off the swamp I mean lit literally
behaving exactly like Nancy py
would they pack that stuff in and they
pass these bills right before Christmas
to say well you want to get home for
Christmas right but he's using it for
he's using a CR to do it which is
different than using a actual spending
bill that big the big spending Bill
comes in March when the year starts for
congress
2025 that's normally when you have these
fights but he's actually using this
opportunity before Trump takes power to
get the final goodies for a swamp FRS it
like this really should cost Mike
Johnson his speakership about to pass a
bill that blows away your taxpayer money
but they made it over 1500 pages long so
you wouldn't read it I did you a favor I
read it for you it's supposed to be
about keeping government operations open
and providing disaster relief Aid to
hurricane victims which I'm sympathetic
to but if you read the bill carefully it
contains pay raises for members of
Congress and I'm not making this up an
expansion of their federal health
benefits it contains all kinds of
special interests and pork funding
including opening up a new stadium in
Washington DC it renews the global
engagement Center which is a key node of
the censorship industrial complex and
the worst part is they didn't want you
to know about any of it and that's why
they made this a last minute Jam job the
reason I'm co-head doge is I think we
need Outsiders to bring actual
accountability to Washington DC so feel
free to call your congressman and let
him know how you feel about it ladies
and gentlemen with v reading through the
bill which he did and then summarized
here to to I mean obviously When You're
summarizing 15 uh 1500 pages there's
like too much to actually read through
but please go follow a vake and Elon
Musk hammering this out Elon Musk has
tweeted at least a hundred times today
about it uh members of the House Began
to break Rank and come out against it
more members of the House Began to uh
demonstrate like here this is what Mike
Johnson wants to pass this is what a
normal continuing resolution looks like
Nancy ma here saying the last ER was 21
Pages this one is500 let that sink
in more taxpayer dollars flushed down
the drain the actual bill is insane here
it is right here on your screen it's
insane I'm gonna break my hand off just
scrolling short-term funding CR bill is
meant to avert a government shutdown
includes a one-year extension of the
state Department's Global engagement
Center which is currently being sued by
multiple media organizations for
censorship which it
is it
expands the vaccine mandate mask mandate
vaccine passports intentional emergency
powers and gain of function
research this is
insanity pay increases for members of
Congress from $174,000 a year which is
Rich by any standard to 254 a quarter of
a million dollars a year to be a member
of Congress what
garbage do do you think they deserve a
pay raise for lying to you with the CR
uh as as um our leader just noted we
have um we have broken the Christmas
Omni and I have no intention of going
back to that terrible tradition so there
won't be a Christmas Omni bus and
somebody asked me in the hallway a
little while ago will there be many
buses I we don't want any buses we're
not going to do any buses okay and we
got to get through this so look
everybody understands the necessity it
is not palatable this is the sausage
making part of legislation that nobody
likes but we're governing and and we'll
we'll uh pick it up in January and start
a brand new day for America what a liar
what a freaking
liar Congressional resolution Bill
includes at least 12 new
biolabs it includes a provision where
you can block subpoenas for house data
including emails and potentially
preventing investigation in the January
6
it's
incredible it's it is I mean truly it is
an
Abomination but
thankfully because Elon Musk was able to
actually Hammer
home yeah this is a was able to like
literally Hammer home the threats
against members of
Congress uh I think that we've
effectively killed the bill Fox news
reporting that because Donald Trump has
now come out against the bill and Elon
Musk has threatened seats of members of
Congress that the bill is Bill off the
floor and maybe just go with a clean
bill unclear what that means for
Disaster Assistance here's what happened
a post on X by Elon Musk sent shock
waves through the capital House
Republicans were trying to see if they
have enough votes to pass the spending
bill in the next hour or two musk posted
that anyone who votes yes should lose
their office in two years and lawmakers
are scrambling
the tweets from musk and know has that
complicated this well I mean I think
that there's always a lot of um interest
in what's happening up here and uh this
is more than interest they're telling
people if they vote Yes they should be
voted out the social media uh world is a
part of our politics and um I think uh
members have to expect that there going
to be a lot of hard votes in the next
couple of
years a member of the House Republican
leadership told Fox that musk is not
helping the lawmaker added that musk has
bigger fish to fry than picking a fight
with House Republicans One Source said
the bill is now bleeding support from
the GOP when asked how many Democrats
the GOP needs to pass the Bill a senior
Aid replied quote a lot lawmakers who
had hurricanes devastate their districts
are
torn uh I had a member of Congress who
lives in a hurricane devastated District
here in Florida call me and say that
Republican leadership were threatening
to withhold hurricane funding from their
District if they don't support
this I mean it's it's completely and
totally Sinister it's complete
backstabbing Behavior by Mike Johnson
who's never shy about taking selfies
with Elon Musk or
V make sure that we always talk about
how cool it is to be in the do like to
be on the side of cutting federal
spending and then backstabs them post
her photos then back St them with the
American voters behind camera to truly
sick it's the worst type of grotesque
political
opportunism yeah well apparently ladies
and gentlemen it's dead Donald Trump has
said that he is totally against the
massive bloated spending Bill and that
Trump wants the fight against government
overspending to start right now so
massive win for Elon Musk and V Ram
Swami all the reports are now that this
bill is completely dead and that they're
going to bring a clean continuing
resolution to the floor and we'll get a
clean spending
bill which is just simply continue
government spending as it is ADD nothing
else and we start there okay stop the
bleeding as they say right don't add
more debt stay where it is and then cut
start cutting debt with the next big
Bill that starts in
March this is the this is an
unbelievable C change I've never seen
anything like it they were going to do
business as usual pork FAL spending for
special interests in lobbying groups for
a bunch of that nobody in
America needs or wants and we stopped it
today by exposing them using AI to read
the bill and expose what's actually in
it and using the most powerful media
tool in the world acts and the most
powerful man in the world who's a
private citizen Elon Musk the richest
man in the world to kill kill businesses
as usual in Washington DC they're on
notice it's amazing it's amazing what's
happening this will be the last time
this happens it'll never be able to
happen again where they do this because
the technology is now there and the
awareness more importantly the awareness
is all there because the country ladies
and gentlemen looks like this and this
country uh ain't down ain't down with
the swamp ladies and gentlemen down with
the swamp it's your boy by like share

Elon Musk And Vivek Ramaswamy TRIGGER Congress Into OUTRAGE As DOGE FORCES Government SHUT DOWN!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-anyDLVYYQ,"we have um we have broken the Christmas
Omni and I have no intention of going
back to that terrible tradition so there
won't be a Christmas Omni bus as
somebody asked me in the hallway a
little while ago will there be many
buses I we don't want any buses we're
not going to do any buses okay um and
I've seen this play call like four times
in the seven years I've been in Congress
they've punted the ball until December
20th and what they'll do is they'll come
in in a closed room with us and they'll
say okay now we've got the really big
Omnibus and if you vote for this you can
go home for Christmas but if you don't
vote for it and it fails we're going to
make you stay here over Christmas and
New Year's and it's almost like a
dystopian future I've been in the closed
room where they start chanting vote vote
vote vote yeah and people run up there
and vote for something they've not read
CRC Congress is about to pass a bill
that blows away your taxpayer money but
they made it over 1500 pages long so you
wouldn't read it I did you a favor I
read it for you it's supposed to be
about keeping government operations open
and providing disaster relief Aid to

the worst part is they didn't want you
to know about any of it and that's why
they made this a last minute Jam job the
reason reason I'm co-head doge is I
think we need Outsiders to bring actual
accountability to Washington DC so feel
free to call your congressman and let
them know how you feel about it I think
about what Elon and Bea said yes I agree
with them
100% I would they're I was a no on the
CR before I even got an airplane and
came to Washington I haven't voted on
one yet do you think Republicans will be
able to get anywhere next year on their
effort to cut spending yeah look next
year's a different scenario we're not
dealing with Chuck Schumer in the Senate
we're going to have Donald Trump in the
white house we will have a narrow
majority in the house but we have to be
able to do it next year so you know
we're stuck in the same scenario here
but still the CR is completely
inexcusable it's it's horrible all right
guys so it's another year and that means
more of the same pork barrel tricks that
the politicians love to use as an excuse
to steal your taxpayer money at the end
of every year by basically Ally forcing
their colleagues to pass a spending bill
that they haven't read called A
continuing resolution before the
holidays so that they can go home on
vacation or else the government will
shut down okay and nobody wants to say
they're responsible for the government
shut down right from the money
continuing to flow from the federal
government now keep in mind a vast
majority of these politicians have
basically been on vacation the past few
months because they certainly haven't
done a damn thing okay outside of
raising money from uh Rich folks right
from donors outside of that they haven't
really done much so naturally when some
conservatives ones that actually really
care about fiscal responsibility right
that actually really care about
transparency and wanting to read what
they're voting for right before actually
voting for it when they got this big
pile of garbage on their desk um they
were upset okay and Elon Musk and V
ramaswami two individuals that are
leading Doge have come out here and push
back heavily against this Omnibus pork
fest uh essentially saying that no no no
we cannot continue to do this we
promised the American people that as a
part of Doge we would stop this type of
unnecessary and
non-transparent spending that includes
money not just for pork barrel projects
uh but also to increase the salaries of
the politicians right the most unpopular
Congress probably in American history
right a Congress that a overwhelming
majority of the American people do not
approve of yeah they're looking for a
pay raise right they want to raise their
pay Members are giving themselves a pay
raise do you guys deserve a pay raise
well that's news to me it's good news
you know what has it been 10 years or 14
years and no Cola no change at all I
think it's about time something son you
you support King giving yourself is how
would I not no reason but I mean but I
mean people look at the performance of
Congress say why should we give them
more money what about the media think
about that for a second and we're not
paid by public money I know you're not
but I mean half of your listeners are
not there anymore you still getting the
same paycheck what's going on well I
mean you're taxpayer money I mean you
guys deserve a
raise and uh Duran it's actually said
that yes they should give themselves a
raise and well also that's noticeable
though the Jim he wasn't aware that this
was in the provision and he's the number
two Senate Democrat just shows you how
this was negotiated among handful of
members and they're going to have to
vote on this and members L won't have a
time to read it either Jim unreal but
Manu I have to say you are worth every
penny uh monu Raju up on Capitol Hill
for us thank you thank you very much
yeah so does anybody think that makes
sense right how in the world does CNN
the media catch a politician off guard
and say hey did do you agree with giving
yourself a pay raise and the politician
didn't even know because they didn't
even have time to read the bill they
didn't even know that the pay raise was
in the
bill again it just shows you how much of
a scam this
is nobody has an opportunity to actually
sit down and to figure out what the hell
is in this piece of legislation before
they vote on it right but Mike Johnson
he insists that no no no no we got to
pass this bill anyways guys you don't
understand next year is when we get get
started with the real work right the
promises that we made via Doge okay that
we're going to stop all this no no no we
actually got to do it next year have a
choice we have to fund those we have to
fund femo we have to fund our Farmers
right and and Mr speak and Mr Speaker
it's not just so you've got a bunch of
Republicans who are angry at you they
they don't like this and uh just in a
couple of weeks you're going to stand
once again to run for speaker of the
house and you don't need a bunch of
Democrats mad at you but you know and
this is breaking new news you do not
know you know who also does not like
this Elon Musk the world's richest man
just tweeted this bill should not pass
the only way you're going to be able to
pass it now Mr Speaker is with Democrats
if you could if you could what's your
message to Elon Musk well I was
communicating with Elon last night Elon
and V and I are on a text chain together
and I was explaining to them the
background of this and V and I talked
last night about almost midnight and he
said look I get it he said we understand
you're in an impossible position
everybody knows that remember guys we
still have just a razor thin margin of
Republicans so any bill has to have
Democrat votes they understand the
situation they said it's not directed to
you Mr Speaker but we don't like the
spending I said guess what fellas I
don't either we got to get this done
because here's the key by doing this we
are clearing the decks and we are
setting up for Trump to come in Roaring
back with the America First agenda
that's what we're going to run with
gusto beginning January 3rd when we
start the new Congress when Republicans
again were in control and all of our
fiscal conservative friends I'm one of
them will be able to finally do the
things that we have been wanting to do
for the last couple years right now
Democrats still control pins and that's
the problem so we got to get this thing
done so we don't have the shutdown so we
get the short-term funding measure and
we get to March where we can put our
fingerprints on the spending that's when
the big changes start and we can't wait
to get there right yeah so this is the
same type of argument that fat people
use to justify waiting until New Year's
before they go on a diet right they say
well no no no you don't understand it's
the holidays and I just want to enjoy
myself now I just want to keep eating
now even though I promise I promise that
I'm going to cut it out that I'm
actually going to change my lifestyle I
I promise I'm going to do it uh but I'm
just going to do it later right at the
beginning of the year and this is why at
vast majority of the time um those New
Year's resolution diets fail because it
wasn't a serious thing right people when
you want to make a serious life style
change you do it in that moment you say
from this moment I am now making this
change and I'm going to stick with it
you don't wait to some arbitrary date
that you feel is special for whatever
reason to make the change right you make
the change immediately and clearly you
can see that the GOP they don't seem to
be very serious about the changes that
they claim that they're going to make
the things they claim they're going to
do when it comes to cutting out all of
this unnecessary spending this theft of
taxpayer dollars because they were
serious they would start to do it now
not later later especially when you have
the power okay this is why I do not
throw Mike Johnson in the same category
as everybody else when I talk about the
magga Avengers right when all of them
are together at some event and Mike
Johnson's there I always leave out Mike
Johnson because I'm like nah I don't
really think he deserves the title right
I don't think he should be a part of the
group okay and stuff like this is what
I'm talking about so with that being
said again vas Swami Eli musk and now
president-elect Trump have come out
against this so-called continuing
resolution and that is sending Capitol
Hill into chaos take a look we're told
right now in the past 30 or 40 minutes
here that they might try to pull this
interim spending bill off the floor and
maybe just go with a clean bill unclear
what that means for Disaster Assistance
here's what happened a post on X by Elon
Musk sent shock waves through the
capital House Republicans were trying to
see if they have enough votes to pass
the spending bill in the next hour or
two musk posted that anyone who votes
yes should lose their office in two
years and lawmakers are
scrambling tweets from musk and has that
complicated this well I mean I think
that there's always a lot of um interest
in what's happening up here and uh this
is more than interest they're telling
people if they vote Yes they should be
voted out the social media uh world is a
part of our politics and um I think uh
members have to expect that there going
to be a lot of hard votes in the next
couple of
years a member of the House Republican
leadership told Fox that musk is not
helping the lawmaker added that musk has
bigger fish to fry than picking a fight
with House Republicans One Source said
the bill is now bleeding support from
the GOP when asked how many Democrats
the GOP needs to pass the Bill a senior
Aid replied quote a lot lawmakers who
had hurricanes devastate their districts
are
torn the fact is is that look this is a
sandwich I don't know how to say that
we're being forced into this position
they could have done a standalone they
did this because they knew that it would
put members in this position to support
it we're damned if we do we're damned if
we
don't now the bill has about $100
billion in disaster relief nearly 30
billion to restock FEMA coffers and
there are lots of healthc care
Provisions jamming everything together
in one bill means some Republicans will
not support Mike Johnson for speaker in
January have any other of your
colleagues said that they're not voting
for Johnson any Express I've talked to a
few you know who don't seem like they're
going to vote for him you have to ask
them I'm not going to betray anybody's
Position will you just vote president or
will you vote someone else's I'll vote
for somebody
else now Johnson can only lose one vote
and still win the speaker race on
January 3rd some Republicans ask how
things are different with a spending
Bill like this under Johnson than former
house Speaker Kevin McCarthy the funding
deadline is Friday Night Neil Financial
Services committee Byron donals Carson
this bill will fund much of what doge is
looking to cut what's going
on unfortunately this is what happens in
the lame duck here on Capitol Hill
listen there was a historic election a
mandate given to president Trump people
want government efficiencies they want
lower spending but the swamp and frankly
Congressional Democrats want what they
want and it was it was that or Farmers
suffer and it's a very unfortunate Bill
listen what we have here is a bill that
puts disaster recovery for a state like
mine of Florida and many other states
and that was held hostage to get EV
mandates and all this other stuff uh
through this package personally as a
member I have to vote no because I'm not
voting for this this kind of garbage uh
this is a bad Bill it should not pass uh
Elon Musk is correct a lot of my
colleagues are correct um in my view uh
we should go back to the drawing board
immediately Disaster Recovery should
move on its own and when it comes to the
other functions of government it should
be a slim deal until Donald Trump comes
back then yeah so you seen that you
heard that now Elon Musk and B ramaswami
having such an influence over what's
happening in Congress clearly is rubbing
people the wrong way okay Republicans
and Democrats to tank this I mean we
have we have two unelected billionaires
who are telling the American people
going into Christmas that the
government's going to be shut down that
our air traffic controllers won't be
operating that TSA won't be there to
help you at the Air Force you're
traveling to see your loved
ones really who are the I mean Elon Musk
is an unelected billionaire who's the
other one well Donald Trump obviously
not in office yet um I don't know where
R yes fair fair enough fair enough
hanging by a
thread well first off I'd like to say
thank the Lord God that I am not in
Congress anymore I know this game they
always play this like Christmas deadline
stupid game but look president musk this
morning made it clear with all his vast
government experience which is basically
he became rich on the federal government
that he doesn't want Republicans to pass
this and seemingly vice president Trump
kind of backed him up then at that point
and what it says about the politics is
this is going to be a messy four years
the whole debt sealing thing Donald
Trump is making it clear that he wants
the debt seiling to go up by the way the
debt ceiling is going to have to go up
but he doesn't want to have to take
ownership for it because he will again
for four years look at the Democrats and
blame them and so what this says about
the politics is good luck for the next
four years I don't think they'll shut
the government down because ultimately
they'll want to get home for Christmas
they'll do like a one Monon CR
pretending like that's going to fix
everything but uh yeah I mean I think
president Elon has made it clear what
his agenda is going to be for the next
four years yeah it does seem that the
only thing that truly moves Capitol Hill
is vacations in my experience watching
that building behind me House
Republicans have now unilaterally
decided to break a bipartisan
agreement that they
made House
Republicans have been
ordered to shut down the government and
hurt everyday
Americans all across this
country house Republican
will now own any harm that is visited
upon the American people that results
from a government shutdown or Worse an
agreement is an agreement it was
bipartisan and there was nothing more to
say thank you yeah so there a bunch of
things in this bill that nobody has read
that nobody really understands uh that
is packed into this bill
that these politicians are being forced
to vote on at the last minute like for
example there's a one-year extension of
the state Department's Global engagement
Center which funded an advertisers
Blacklist of the post and other outlets
to purportedly crack down on
misinformation right so there's quite
literally funding in here to fuel more
citizenship right it's that type of
stuff right it's the small things that
nobody is going to read right nobody is
going to go over say hey does this make
sense right should we be funding this
yeah that type of stuff is in this bill
okay and that is what people are upset
about a lot of this stuff should be
voted on individually okay a lot of this
spending uh like for example when it
comes to the hundred billion dollar in
disaster relief why can't you vote on
that individually right why can't you
have just a clean bill and a yes or no
right why can't you do that 30 billion
for FEMA funding say thing all of these
things I think some of the stuff people
may agree on some stuff people may say
okay hey we need more funding for X Y
and Z right but
but it should be something that each
politician is voting on individually not
something that's stacked inside this
large thousand Page Plus bill that is
impossible to read that's the problem
here that's the issue
these politicians for the last few
months they haven't been
working they've been raising money yes
some of them are running for reelection
but they haven't been working they could
have been working
on having individual votes on this stuff
way before this way before
this but they wait till the end of the
year they stuff it all in one bill and
then they play this game of political
hot potato
with the government shutdown right with
the deadline to extend
funding and American people are sick and
tired of they're sick and tired of the
political games and Mike Johnson he's in
trouble he's in big big big trouble okay
because you already have some
Republicans coming out and say yeah yeah
we're not going to vote for Mike Johnson
because of this this guy at this point
he's only a marginal upgrade over Kevin
McCarthy again this is what got Kevin
McCarthy ousted this type of behavior so
he's going to have a hard time winning
the speakership right he's going to have
a really really really hard time winning
over the people that are now pissed off
by the fact that again this guy seems to
be some of the same old same old same
old same old and that end of itself is
going to cause him issues because he may
have to capitulate the Democrats he may
have to make a deal with Democrats to
remain speaker and that means he will be
compromised which definitely will not be
good for the American first agenda right
it's not going to be good so with that
being said Mike Johnson should pass a
clean continuing resolution okay no pork
add-ons and whatever other add-ons that
they feel are necessary should be voted
on individually individually so that
there's maximum transparency in regards
to what is being voted on that's what
should happen or else hey if Democrats
don't want to get on board with that
then let them deal with the shutdown
Biden's in office right they're still in
office they can deal with the shutdown
and you just make the case
listen Democrats want all these projects
they don't want transparency they don't
want transparency all we're asking for
is for them to actually vote on each
bill
individually that's it that's it put the
ball in Democrats
court but again transparency is needed
and the reason why these politicians do
this why they wait till the last minute
to pass these massive spending bills
every single year is because that's
exactly what they do not want so let me
know what you guys think make sure you
like comment and subscribe most
importantly share a black consern
perspective peace"
